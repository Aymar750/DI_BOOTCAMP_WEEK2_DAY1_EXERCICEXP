let c;
let a = 34;
let b = 21;

console.log(a+b) //first expression
// Prediction: It will outpout 55,because 34 and 21 are numbers
// Actual:55

a = 2;

console.log(a+b) //second expression
// Prediction: It will outpout 23,because 34 is replaced by 2 and 2 21 are numbers
// Actual:23

//c don't have value yet

console.log(3 + 4 + '5');
//prediction: it will outpout 75,because in the expression 3 + 4 + '5', the first operation to be performed is 3 + 4, which results in 7. Then, the string '5' is concatenated to the number 7, resulting in the string '75'.;
